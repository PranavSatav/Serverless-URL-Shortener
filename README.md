# Serverless-URL-Shortener
This PHP code represents a basic URL shortener web application. It allows users to input a long URL, optionally provide a custom short URL, and then generates a shortened URL. The application maintains a database of short-to-long URL mappings and displays recently shortened URLs along with associated IP locations and creation dates.
